# Networking Insights: From Basics to Advanced
## What is Networking?
Networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources, communicate & exchange data. It involves using hardware, software & protocols to ensure devices can interact efficiently within a local or global network. It involves some terminology likes :
### 1. Communication 
It is the process of sending information from one place to another place using signals via a medium.
### 2. Information
Information is data that has been processed or organized in a way that makes it meaningful and useful. Any type of Data like Text, Image, Audio & Video is called Information.
### 3. Medium
A medium is the physical path or channel through which signals travel from one place to another. It can be classified into two types :
1. **Wired** - Signals travel through physical cables or wires.
2. **Wireless** - Signals travel through the air, using electromagnetic waves.
### 4. Signal 
A signal is the way information is transmitted through a medium. It can be classified into the following types :
1. **Analog** – Continuous signals that vary in amplitude or frequency (e.g., sound waves).
2. **Digital** – Discrete signals represented by binary values (0s and 1s).
3. **Electrical** – Signals transmitted using electrical currents or voltages.
4. **Optical (Light)** – Signals transmitted using light, often through fiber optics.
5. **Radio Frequency (RF)** – Signals transmitted through electromagnetic waves in the radio frequency spectrum (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular networks).
